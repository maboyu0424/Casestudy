hello to our project!

Due to our project is not so big , so we can say that: 

Maboyu is more responsible for the dart code, and Ifran is more focus on the html part.

Just like this:

Ifran make done the Html page ,and he also create a main.dart,and write like this:

1.NumberInputElement submit = querySelector('#submit') as NumberInputElement;

2.SelectElement venue = querySelector("#venues") as SelectElement;

, because he need to explain to Maboyu how are elements in HTML represented in dart.

And maboyu know that, and can to do the last part :caculate that the number of time plus the number of room plus the number of date,and display the booking date.

But the Core algorithm part(can we say that??) is the product of our discussion.

in short(Core algorithm):we code everything into a number, room is a number,hour and minute is a number.

Then add them all into a List<int?> and display them 1 by 1.

In HTML, the user can select the room,the starting time of using and the ending time of using,then submit it.

In dart, once the user press the submit button, then it will get all the data,for example:room number,date of year,month,day.date of hour,minute.

The core algorithm is to code everthing into a number,for example:I choose room 1 at 2022/12/05 from 8:00 to 10:00,then it will be recorded at List as '10800105'.

If you want to add it into the list again ,and the code responsible for the detection will display an error and prevent the same number from being added.

Then we got it.

It's our project.

Other:

We found some problems here, once you downloaded the project code, it might got some errors ,which will be lead the project web serve can't run.

So we recommend that you create your own dart web project if you encounter such a problem. 

In that case, just download the index.html, main.dart, and style.css files and replace them with your own dart web project. 

Then you can use it.
